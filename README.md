# WEB-SCRAP

The web scrap idea is about that you can from www.sreality.cz download flats that are to sell in Czech Republic. 
Once you have filtered the desired area with apartments, web scrap downloads the data into Excel, where it calculates the average of the offered advertisements and
writes the address and size of the apartment in individual columns
